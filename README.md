# storing-last-played-songs-on-spotify-into-database
It's a mini project based on etl services,where i am requesting spotify api for json file of my last played songs on soptify and after transforming the relevant data storing it into the database.
Generate your Spotify API access token here: https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-recently-played/
# How My Code Works?
My code is actually pretty simple.
we can divide the code into three modules which are :
* requesting api for the data of your last played songs // extract process
* converting the json file into relevant information according to your need // transform process
* storing the transformed file into your database // load process
